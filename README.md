# Give or Take a Few Representations

This repository is home base for the "Give or take a few representations", one of 5 final projects for the FA '22 iteration of _Computational Linguistics II_ (LING 4435) at Cornell University; a rough outline of the topics covered in this course can be found [here](https://vansky.github.io/courses/2020-cl2.html). This project is in collaboration with [Jacob Matthews](https://github.com/jam963) (second author) and [Dr. Marten van Schijndel](https://vansky.github.io/) (course instructor, advisor).

The main goal of this project is to examine how large language models represent light-verb constructions (LVCs). More information about this project -- both in this README file and elsewhere in this repository -- will be updated over the following few weeks. cd

The current dataset for this project is a Frankensteinien amalgamation of the datasets constructed by Yuancheng Tu and Dan Roth for their 2011 paper ["Learning English Light Verb Constructions: Contextual or Statistical"](https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/page/publication_view/662) and their 2012 paper [Sorting Out the Most Confusing English Phrasal Verbs](https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/page/publication_view/689). Major thanks to them for building easy-to-use datasets.
