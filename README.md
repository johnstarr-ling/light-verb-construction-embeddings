# Give or take a few representations

This repository is home base for the "Give or take a few representations", one of 5 final projects for the FA '22 iteration of _Computational Linguistics II_ (LING 4435) at Cornell University; a rough outline of the topics covered in this course can be found [here](https://vansky.github.io/courses/2020-cl2.html). This project is in collaboration with [Jacob Matthews](https://github.com/jam963) (second author) and [Dr. Marten van Schijndel](https://vansky.github.io/) (course instructor, advisor).

The main goal of this project is to examine how large language models represent light-verb constructions (LVCs). More information about this project -- both in this README file and elsewhere in this repository -- will be updated over the following few weeks.
